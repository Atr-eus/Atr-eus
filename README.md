- Currently, I'm exploring:
  - Low level programming in general
  - Cybersecurity
- At the time of writing this, I'm also exploring the world of DSA and trying to strengthen the basics not only for CS but also for engineering.
- I like anime and manga of *all* types. But if I had to choose my absolute favorite, it would be K-ON. ~~Don't worry if you've never heard of it.~~
- I'm also a fellow desktop Linux enthusiast and a passionate Windows hater.

  - Anime, Manga, Novels, Games, Web series
  - Anything related to tech
