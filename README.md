<!--
**Anindya-ctrl/Anindya-ctrl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- I'm an aspiring software engineer who is perpetually astonished and intrigued by the world of technology.
- I'm currently attending a CSE undergraduate course.
- I've primarily worked on full-stack web development.
- At the time of writing this, I'm exploring the world of DSA and trying to strengthen the basics not only for CS but also for engineering.
- Recently, I've started doing CTF challenges; perhaps I'll commit more time to cybersecurity.
- I like anime and manga of *all* types. But if I had to choose my absolute favorite, it would be K-ON. Don't worry if you've never heard of it.
- I'm also a fellow desktop Linux enthusiast and a passionate Windows hater.
